##naive bayes calcification overview

The Naive Bayes classifier is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning, renowned for its simplicity and effectiveness in 
various classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' Theorem, which provides a mathematical framework for calculating the probability 
of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions 
related to the event. The term "naive" refers to the strong independence assumptions it makes between features.
