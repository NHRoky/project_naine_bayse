## Naive bayes calcification overview

The Naive Bayes classifier is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning, renowned for its simplicity and effectiveness in 
various classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' Theorem, which provides a mathematical framework for calculating the probability 
of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions 
related to the event. The term "naive" refers to the strong independence assumptions it makes between features.

# üîç Understanding Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of probabilistic algorithms that apply Bayes' theorem with the assumption of feature independence. Despite this "naive" assumption, they perform remarkably well in various real-world situations, especially in text classification and spam detection
 Bayes' Theorem:
 p(y|X1,...,Xn)= P(y).p(x1,...,xn|y)/p(X1,...,Xn)
 In practice, since ( p(X1,...,Xn)) is constant for all classes, we can simplify the computation by focusing on the numerator
